  Latest Build Updates
</h2>
<p>
  Stage 1 of development has been almost completed in just under 24 hours of resetting development. I've gone for a <i>hackerman</i> kind of theme for the application with   the     gray-blue and "Dark Carribean Green" colour scheme. Stage 2 will involve implementing the code-behind of the controls and creating a functioning, though probably broken           program. Stage 3 will just be heavy debugging and code refactoring to find and rectify any bugs and improve code readbility. Finally, Stage 4 involves me and a select others       testing the application for stability and functionality. Should any issues be discovered there will be delays in release.
</p>
<p>
  For those really wanting a release date, although not guaranteed in any way, I will estimate that will be around March 8th if no delays are encountered.
